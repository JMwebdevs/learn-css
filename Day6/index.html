        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
          Shin is fiercely loyal to his friends as shown when he vows to avenge <br>
          Hyou, even at the risk of his own death. He is extremely hotheaded and <br>
          brash but carries a heart of gold that holds an extreme amount of <br>
          determination, His hot temper also made him clash with Ka Ryo Ten and <br>

          they tend to bicker like siblings constantly back when they were <br>
          younger. Despite his brashness, Shin has showed himself to be quite a <br>
          teaser, regularly poking fun towards his comrades and friends. <br><br> He is
          also capable of great rage when provoked by others, making him <br>
          deadly opponent to fight against. His long days as a servant spent <br>
          with Hyou made them inextricably linked and thus bring him up various <br>
          times during his life. <br><br> Shin is a very headstrong and courageous man <br>
          which is evident where he unhesitatingly challenges fierce enemies <br>
          often ones that are much stronger than him (such as Sa Ji, Ma Ki, and <br>
          to a much greater extent, Hou Ken, Rin Ko, and Ren Pa). Shin also
