          Ri Shin, formerly known as Shin, is the main protagonist of Kingdom.
          He is the leader of the powerfully famous specialist army unit, the Hi
          Shin Unit, and a General of the Qin Military. He pursues the dream of
          becoming the Greatest General underneath the Heavens which was given

          to him by his late adoptive/sworn brother Hyou as he inspired Shin to
          take up the sword and aim for the goal of one day going to the
          battlefield to become Great Generals, with him wanting to inch and
          have their names go down in history. Originally an orphan who was
          raised as a slave in Jouto, a small village in the state of Qin's
          countryside, Shin left the village after witnessing Hyou's death and
          met Ei Sei, the 31st king of the state of Qin and Ka Ryo Ten, a
          lookout for an outlaws village, as they became embroiled in the young

          king's battle for his throne during his half brother's rebellion. As a
          military commander, Shin has fiercely participated in numerous
          campaigns and countless battlefields throughout the Warring States of
          Zhongyuan, having begun his career as a simple Infantry soldier
          fighting under the famous and late Duke Hyou in the Battle at Dakan
          Plains against the Wei Military and eventually clashing with others
          like the Zhao Military, the famed General Rin Ko of Ren Pa's Four
          <img class="odd" src="img/images.jpg" width="400px" alt="" />
          Heavenly Kings, the combined forces of the Coalition Army, the Ryo Fui
          Faction, and his militaristic rival and archenemy, Ri Boku and his
          cohorts in the form of powerful allies from both present and previous
          era of the War God. Despite his youth and relative inexperience, Shin
          has repeatedly clashed with formidable military opponents and secured
          victories across numerous battlefronts. Rising to the rank of 100-Man
          Commander after his first campaign, he distinguished himself by
          eliminating key figures in the Go Kei Army and played a crucial role
          <img class="even" src="img/dadsa.webp" width="400px" alt="" />
          in the Keiyou Campaign. He later assisted Great General Ou Ki in the
          Battle of Bayou, facing off against the Three Great Heavens, and
          became a key figure in the successful invasion of Sanyou, where he
          directly contributed to Qin's victory over the legendary Ren Pa and
          his army. Under Duke Hyou, he fought in the Battle of Kankoku Pass,
          playing a vital role in key developments against the Zhao armies and
          personally slaying the sadistic Man Goku. Shin was later entrusted
          with the role of commander in the Battle of Sai, where he faced the
          Bushin Hou Ken, a foe he would ultimately defeat and kill on the final
          <img class="odd" src="img/dfaiufydias.jpg" width="400px" alt="" />
          day of the Battle at Shukai Plains years later. Shin has gained fame
          across the Warring States through his accomplishments, martial
          prowess, being one of the strongest combatants of his generation's
          military commanders, contributions to the Ei Sei Faction, and desire
          to Unify China as well as the focused hostility of Ri Boku in
          particular.
