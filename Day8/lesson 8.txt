 Properties:  
    1. Display: block;
                    - Takes up 100% of the width of its container by default.
                    - Starts on a new line.
                                        Example:
                                                - <div>
                                                - <p> 
                                                - <h1> 
                                                - <section>

    2. Display: inline; 
                    - Only takes up as much width as needed.
                    - Stays on the same line with other inline elements.
                    - You cannot set width or height.
                                        Example:
                                                - <span>
                                                - <a>
                                                - <strong>
    3. Display: inline-block;
                    - Behaves like inline (sits on the same line).
                    - But also behaves like block (you can set width and height).
                    - Perfect for buttons or elements you want side-by-side but still have box-like control.
